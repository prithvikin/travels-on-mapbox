# My Travels on Mapbox
I've been fortunate enough to have traveled to 38 countries around the world. As the number continues to grow, I wanted to build an interactive map on a modern platform. Iâ€™ve chosen Mapbox and React for this project.

I'm currently trying to build this project while experimenting and building between three different subprojects. This whole process is self-guided, so I'm learning quite a lot while. Unfortunately (or some might say fortunately), it means that this project continues to take a good amount of my time.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out to me directly at prk8cr@virginia.edu
